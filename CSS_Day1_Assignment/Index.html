    >First Moon Mission</h3>
        <p style="margin: 50px;
        text-align: justify;" >
        The first US space mission was Project Mercury, which launched Alan Shepard into suborbital space on May 5, 1961. Shepard's flight lasted for 15 minutes and 28 seconds, and he reached a maximum altitude of 116 miles. His capsule, Freedom 7, splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean.

        Project Mercury was a major achievement for the United States, and it helped to pave the way for the Apollo program, which landed humans on the Moon in 1969.

    > Apollo 11 Landing</h3>

            <p style="margin: 50px; text-align: start;">
                The Apollo program was a series of crewed space missions undertaken by the United States from 1968 to 1972 with the goal of landing humans on the Moon and safely returning them to Earth. It was a massive undertaking that involved the efforts of hundreds of thousands of people and cost billions of dollars.
                On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 achieved its goal when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. Armstrong famously declared, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
                Five more successful lunar landings followed, with the last Apollo mission returning to Earth in 1972. The Apollo program was a major achievement for the United States and for humanity, and it remains one of the most iconic moments in human history.
